Welcome to the Student Performance API, a RESTful API built using ASP.NET Core for managing student academic records and calculating performance metrics such as average marks.

This project is developed and maintained by Muhle Ntuli, a passionate Bachelor of IT student with a strong interest in cloud technologies, backend development, and project management.

 Project Overview:

The API supports the following functionalities:
- Add, view, update, and delete student records
- Store and retrieve student performance data (assignment and test marks)
- Automatically calculate average marks
- Future enhancements will include:
  - Qualification logic (e.g. pass/fail based on average)
  - Reporting and data aggregation via SQL (AVG, MIN, MAX queries)
  - CI/CD pipeline with Azure DevOps
  - Frontend integration for a user-friendly dashboard

 Tech Stack:

- C# / ASP.NET Core Web API
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server (Amazon RDS)
- Swagger** for API documentation and testing
- Git + GitHub** for version control
- (Soon: Azure DevOps, Power BI, and more)

Project Status:

ðŸŸ¡ **In Progress** â€” This is a learning-focused project. I'm continuously improving features, structure, and documentation. Feedback is welcome!
